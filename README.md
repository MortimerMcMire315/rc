Feel free to copy any fragments of the configurations found here.

####Notes
* .vimrc depends on Vundle, though it could easily be changed to use Pathogen or any other Vim plugin manager.
* The terminal configuration uses the "DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline" font, which I modified from [the patched Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
The arrow glyphs in that package were too tall (probably due to the way they're displayed in xfce4-terminal), 
so I edited them with fontforge to make them shorter.
* I've mostly been coding in Haskell lately, so a couple of my Vim configs are pretty Haskell-centric.
* The bashrc is kind of a mess. I apologize to anyone who looks at it.
